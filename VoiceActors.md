# Voice Actors

These are the CURRENT voice actors.
If you think you can do a better job, by all means, send me some samples!

The character whose name is is prefixed with an asterisk have their voice acting absolutely in the "FINAL" version.
That is to prevent having 10,000 different voice actors for the same guy/girl.

A few notes about the original voice actors
- All of them are amateurs
- None of them speak English natively
- Except for myself (Jeroen P. Broks) I am no longer in touch with ANY of these voice actors. It is therefore pretty senseless to criticize them as I deem the chance they will read it and be willing to actually learn from your critics pretty low.
- It's not because I deem these voice actors "bad" that I offer the possibility to replace them. I'm just saying that if you have the guts to pull them down, well let's hear if you can do better, and if you can do better I'll put you in, and if not, well then I'm not interested :P


And if you do want to try better then:
- Have the guts to send me your bad recordings as well, and allow me to put them in the "Outtakes" section at the end of the game. We did that too.
