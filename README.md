This repository contains the source code of "The Fairy Tale REVAMPED" as it currently is.
This repository ONLY contains the source coude of the Launcher and of the used Lua scripts and installation scripts. Assets, maps and anything storyline related will not be included.

You may use the launcher if you remove all references to "The Fairy Tale", its characters or the Phantasar universe from it under the terms of the GNU General Public License 3.0
The Lua Scripts may if stripped from all references to "The Fairy Tale", its characters or the Phantasar universe from it be used under the terms ofthe zLib license providing you mark your scripts as being modified as per terms of the zLib license (yeah of course you may note (actually I prefer if you do) that the sources were originally used for this game, but that's where it end, right).

The Launcher is a program on its own, the game itself is written in [LAURA II](https://github.com/TrickyGameTools/LAURA2) and you'll need that tool to get anys script to work. LAURA II has been licensed under the GNU GPL 3 and you can use it freely for your games (yes, even commercial games, as long as you refer to the free site of LAURA II and as long as modified versions remain open-source. The game itself counts as "the data" and is therefore not affected by the GNU GPL license).
