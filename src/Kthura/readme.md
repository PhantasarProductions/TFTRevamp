# Kthura

This folder and its subfolders contain the scripts I used for configuring Kthura for this game.

These are merely copies, so pull requests will always be denied on them, since they won't make sense. The "Projects" folder contains the project file itself containing the main configurarion. The "Script" folder contains the script files that can empower Kthura for extra functionality I needed for this game. These scripts are written in the Lua language.

You may use these scripts as you see fit as long as all references in them to Phantasar characters, its universe or any other relation is removed. The easiest way to start a new project with Kthura is by cannibalizing an existing project, so these files can come in handy for your own projects ;)
