# My Data Source Files

For a bit of transparency I've decided to put the database files here.

A few notices though.

- You may use these files for you own use ONLY if you strip all references to the Phantasar universe and its characters from them.
- Unlike most of the rest of this repository, these files are merely copies as the originals are stored elsewhere, this has to do with how the MyData tool has been coded. Therefore pull requests are very likely to be be denied.
- These files are processed and also automatically modified by MyData. The field structure is always kept the same, but the actual data is processed by MyData.
- By means of special convertation tools in MyData itself (and sometimes by external tools) the Lua files which are used in game are being exported. This may explain abit about their looks (and also about why there are sometimes ridiculously large commits when there is no apparent need).
- If you are unsure if you the use you have intended for these files don't hesitate to ask more info.
