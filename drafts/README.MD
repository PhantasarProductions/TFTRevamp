# This is a draft directory.

It contains nothing but drafts, that may or may not be used for the game.
Most of the drafts here are communication drafts. Outdated drafts may also be removed from the repository.
\

You can read it if you want, but I'm not sure if it is useful for you. :)

This place can sometimes be used to share some documents with some friends of mine or people active for the project "backstage" in order to review some stuff.

Nothing here is really secret, but nothing here is official either.
